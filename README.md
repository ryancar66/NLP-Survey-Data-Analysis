# NLP-Survey-Data-Analysis
A company had just finished conducting a survey to 16,000 of their employees. They did not have the resources within their team to perform advanced analytics to uncover the insights in their data. These insights which I uncovered were to be presented in a meeting to C-suite executives at the firm. They came to my consulting firm requesting the help of a data scientist.  <br> 
This repository will include two Jupyter Notebook which I've recreated and condensed from some of the script used in the analysis of the client's data. The purpose of this notebook is to provide the viewer an example of the kind of work I've done in a client setting, it is not meant for another git user to run. This repository does not include many other analyses run for this project, it is just a glimpse into the python code used for a NLP analysis. Please refer to the **NLP-Article** repository for more context around Natural Language Processing and how to use the spaCy library
